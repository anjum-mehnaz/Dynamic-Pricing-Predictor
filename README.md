### 1. Loading Data
Imported the dynamic pricing dataset from - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/dynamic-pricing-dataset/data.
Inspected structure, data types, and missing values.

2. Data Pre-processing
Handled missing data and removed outliers.
Converted categorical variables to factors.
Normalized numerical features to improve model performance.

3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Used pair plots, scatter plots, and box plots to explore relationships between features.
Identified correlations and patterns influencing ride costs.

4. Feature Engineering
Created new features from existing variables such as time of day, location category, and customer loyalty.
Analyzed feature importance using Random Forest and Gradient Boosting models.

5. Model Training
Implemented regression models in R, including:
Random Forest Regressor
Gradient Boosting Regressor
Tuned hyperparameters using cross-validation techniques.

6. Model Evaluation
Evaluated models using:
Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
R-squared (RÂ²)
Compared model performance to select the best predictor.

7. Results and Insights
Identified key factors influencing ride pricing such as ride duration, vehicle type, and driver availability.
Provided insights to support data-driven pricing decisions.

8. Technologies Used
R Language
ggplot2, dplyr, randomForest, gbm
RStudio
Kaggle dataset (Dynamic Pricing)
